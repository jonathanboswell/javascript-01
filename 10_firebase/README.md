## APIs and CRUD

|HTTP|CRUD|Further explanation|
|:---|:-----|:-----|
|POST| Create|Most-often utilized to _create_ new resources.
|GET| Read|The HTTP GET method is used to _read_ a resource.
|PUT| Update|Most often utilized for _update_ capabilities.
|DELETE| Delete|Used to _delete_ a resources.

## Understand CRUD Through Public APIs (15 min)

Spend the next few minutes with a partner researching two of the following APIs to see what HTTP methods a developer must use to perform at least one instance of create, read, update and destroy. Further, you must define what exactly is being created, read, updated or deleted. For example, for Facebook what HTTP method on what endpoint must you ping in order to create a post in a feed?

## API options:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter
- YouTube
- Flickr

>Certain APIs may not allow for full CRUD functionality. If you're researching one of these APIs be sure to point out its limitations.

## Firebase, a Back-end Service

So far in this course we have covered how to consume data from third-party APIs, but have not yet created our own API. The work that we have been doing is what is known in the tech industry as client-side or _front-end_ development.

The process of actually creating the API, not consuming it, is what is known as _back-end_ development. You can think of back-end code as all the code living on the server-side, the code that app users never interact with directly. It is the "non-HTML-CSS-JavaScript" code.

Today we are going to learn how to use Firebase, a back-end as a service (BEaaS), to help us create our very own API!
