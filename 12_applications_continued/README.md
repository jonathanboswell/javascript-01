### What is Routing?

- Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in your application
- Routing enables you to navigate to different pages without reloading the entire application
- AngularJS is a Single Page Application (SPA) which has tools to manage routing

### Advanced: ngRoute vs. ui.router

Not all routing is the same. Angular has a native routing library: ngRoute. It is not good. I actually hate it. A lot of people use ui.router. It's better. I love it. Cleaner code, nested templates, 'nough said.

### Advanced: Package Management

- npm > package.json > node_modules
- bower > bower.json > bower_components

More on these next lesson. Now let's see some routing.

## Components

Reusable code that is accessed by more than one view

## How to build

```js
.component('component-name', {
    'templateUrl':  'path/to/component.html',
    'controller':   'ComponentController',
})
```

```html
<component-name></component-name>
```

Hint: A great way to know when to build a component? If you build a Factory...should probably be a component.

## Advanced: Directives

- Components are a quick and easy way to build a directive
- Directives are custom HTML tags that tell AngularJS's compiler to attach/inject special behavior into the DOM at that tag.

```html
<greeting></greeting>
```

Get compiled and outputted to the DOM as:

```html
Hello World
```

Let's play with a component...
